                <p>Government exams in India are competitive exams that are conducted by various government bodies at the national, state, and local levels. These exams are held to recruit candidates for various government jobs such as civil services, banking, railways, defense, and others.

                    These exams are known for their high level of competition and require extensive preparation by candidates. Some of the popular government exams in India include the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) civil services examination, the Staff Selection Commission (SSC) Combined Graduate Level Examination, the Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS) exams, and the Railway Recruitment Board (RRB) exams.</p>

          <td>
            <p>As for the failure statistics, it varies depending on the exam and the year. For instance, in 2019, the pass percentage for the UPSC civil services examination was 12.9%, which means that around 87% of the candidates who appeared for the exam did not qualify. Similarly, in the same year, the pass percentage for the SSC Combined Graduate Level Examination was around 4.3%.

                However, it's important to note that these exams are highly competitive, and many students may choose to appear for them multiple times before clearing them. Additionally, failure in these exams does not necessarily mean that the student has wasted their time, as they may have gained valuable knowledge and experience that can be useful in other areas of their life.</p>
